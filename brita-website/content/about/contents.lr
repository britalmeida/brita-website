body:
I am a Programmer and Technical Artist.
I work with Blender and other tools to make interactive applications.  
With a background on Computer Science, my main interests lie in Computer Graphics, Games, Film and Animation.

I work mostly with Blender, since 2011, to make still, moving and interactive pictures, focusing on improving the tools and process/pipeline.
