I am a Software Engineer and Technical Artist, with a background in Computer Science.

My main interests lie in Computer Graphics, Games, Film and Animation.

I work mostly with Blender, since 2011, to make still, moving and interactive pictures, focusing on improving the tools and pipeline. Most recently, I am employed by Crytek, working with CryEngine on a game production.
