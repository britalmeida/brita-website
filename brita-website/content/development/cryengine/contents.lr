description: 
I worked as junior engine programmer for CRYENGINE in the Support Team and as platform maintainer for Linux and the Android NVidia Shield.

My work consisted on bug fixes, feature requests, cleanup refactors, documentation and clarifications both internally and for licensees.
Technology wise, I worked with C++ and Lua for the engine and with Python for the internal infrastructure tools.
